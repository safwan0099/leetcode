So you will be given 2 arrays and a sum. You have to check if any of the pairs in the array does equal to that sum.
The arrays are not sorted. The return is a boolean value.
For example,

array1 = [4, 1, 2, 4];
array2 = [1, 2, 3, 9];
 
summ = 8;

The first array returns true and the second one returns false.
